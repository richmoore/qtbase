Openssl 1.1 To Do
=================

 * Test dlopen (done)

 * Change from SSLeay_version etc. to OpenSSL_version (done)

 * Build with OPENSSL_API_COMPAT set to the latest API to catch any more
   changed APIs (done)

 * Add support for legacy backend back again!

 * Configure support/test for openssl 1.1

 * Do we need a mutex for the library loading?

 * Re-add support for limiting the set of TLS protocol versions enabled

 * Ensure tests understand that SSL2 isn't there

 * Consider what to do about QT_NO_OPENSSL etc.

 * Length of DSA keys

 * Switch to openssl certificate hostname verification (get name constraint
   support for free).
